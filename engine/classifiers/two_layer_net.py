class TwoLayerNet(object):
    """
    A two-layer fully-connected neural network with ReLU nonlinearity and
    softmax loss that uses a modular layer design. We assume an input dimension
    of D, a hidden dimension of H, and perform classification over C classes.

    The architecture is affine - ReLU - affine - softmax.

    Note that this class does not implement gradient descent; instead, it
    will interact with a separate Solver object that is responsible for running
    optimization.

    The learnable parameters of the model are stored in the dictionary
    self.params that maps parameter names to numpy arrays.
